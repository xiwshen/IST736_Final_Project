# Description

This project was aimed to apply the text mining techniques we learned from class to a sarcasm detection dataset. The "Data Files" folder contains the datasets we used for this 
project. Specifically, "Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2" is the JSON file we used. Based on the course requirements, we used Python to work on this project. All the codes were 
written and executed within the Jupyter Notebook environment.
